# docusense-RAG
Smart search and Q&amp;A system within the context of the documentation you are browsing.

---
## What It Does
- Goes beyond summarization by acting as a **context-aware search engine**.  
- Uses the site’s structure as its knowledge base to provide precise answers.  
- Example:  
  - You're on the Next.js `getServerSideProps` documentation.  
  - You ask: *“How do I implement the context API with TypeScript?”*  
  - Instead of a generic search, DocuSense retrieves the answer directly from the **Next.js docs** (including linked TypeScript guides).
