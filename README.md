## docusense-RAG
Smart search and Q&amp;A system within the context of the specific documentation you are browsing.

Instead of just summarizing, DocuSense acts as a smart search and Q&A system within the context of the specific documentation you are browsing. It understands the site's structure and uses that as its knowledge base to answer your questions.

Imagine you're on the Next.js getServerSideProps documentation page but are confused about how to use it with TypeScript. You open DocuSense and ask: "How do I implement the context api?" Instead of a generic web search, it searches specifically within the Next.js docs (including the linked TypeScript guide) to give you a precise answer.

### The Contextualization Part

This is a little bit complicated at this point as context isn't just the text on the page; it's the entire documentation or page or information that the user is currently on.

1. Dynamic Context Definition
The extension needs to be smart enough to know what "within the docs" means if that's the query by the user. This isn't a hardcoded list of sites. It's a heuristic process.

Strategy 1: URL Pattern Matching (Simple): When activated on https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-server-side-props, the extension parses the URL to define its context as https://nextjs.org/docs/. It will then consider any link starting with this base URL as part of the "contextual knowledge base". This works for most well-structured docs.

Strategy 2: Sitemap & Link Analysis (Advanced): A more robust method is to, upon activation, look for a /sitemap.xml file at the root of the domain. If found, it parses it to understand the entire structure of the docs. It can also spider the site up to a certain depth (e.g., 2 clicks away from the current page) to build a local map of relevant content. This is more powerful but computationally heavier.

Strategy 3: User-Defined Context (Over-the-top kinda): The UI could have a toggle: "Context: This Page | This Section | Entire Docs".

This Page: Only uses the text of the current open tab.

This Section: (Default) Uses the URL pattern strategy to define a section (e.g., nextjs.org/docs/pages/...).

Entire Docs: Uses the sitemap strategy to try and ingest the entire documentation site.

PS: There has to be a way to dynamically define a knowledge boundary based on fuzzy, real-world inputs with robust URL parsing and error handling (what if there's no sitemap?).

2. The "Search for Help" Feature - RAG in a Browser
Essentially building a mini Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system inside a browser extension.

A couple things to note while we are here:
Performance: You can't send the entire docs to an LLM. You must implement a "chunking" and "embedding" step to find the most relevant information first.

Cost Efficiency: It minimizes the number of tokens sent to the (potentially paid) LLM API, making the product viable.

Accuracy: By grounding the LLM's response in retrieved documentation chunks, you drastically reduce hallucinations and provide answers you can trust, complete with sources.

### Proposed Tech Stack (React/Next.js Focused)
Frontend (Popup/Options UI): Next.js (App Router) or React + Vite. Lightweight and fast paired with shadcn/ui.
Chrome Extension APIs: As before (scripting, tabs, runtime, storage).
Background Process/Service Worker: Will alays be a JavaScript file. Maybe leverage ES6+ and Webpack/Rollup to bundle any dependencies.
AI & Search:
(a) Embedding Model: Need a model to convert text to vectors for search. Local model like Google's Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) Lite (can run in the browser with TensorFlow.js) or a free API like Cohere's Embed API (which has a free tier) for the "search" part.
(b) LLM for Synthesis: Google Gemini API is still the only free, generous, and high quality I know out there.
(c): Storage: chrome.storage.local to cache embedded vectors and pre-crawled content for popular docs for fast access on repeat visits.

### Few Considerations/Edge-cases for Now
- Has to be a way around per-user rate limiting. Maybe keep a timestamp of the last request and warn users if they're hitting limits.
- What if the page has no text? What if the sitemap is malformed? What if the LLM API is down? Need to gracefully handle every scenario.
- Could consider either a "fully local" mode that uses smaller, local models (e.g., with Transformers.js) although low quality, for users who work with sensitive data.
- UX-wsie, the answer should be rendered in clean Markdown, with citations (e.g., "Source: Next.js Docs > API Reference > Data Fetching") that are actually links back to the relevant page.
